<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>  Passionate about data & technologies (both new and old), Iâ€™m an analyst at heart with a penchant for cartographic online communication.</p>
<p>I love seeing projects through from start to finish and unleashing my creativity when faced with methodological challenges. I enjoy combining different software solutions and, even more so, programming my own features while automating the processing and analysis of spatial data.</p>
